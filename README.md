# ðŸš¦ Traffic Analyzer - Smart Traffic Light Optimization

## Overview
Traffic Analyzer is an AI-powered web application designed for government agencies to analyze traffic patterns and optimize traffic light durations. It uses **YOLO (Object Detection)** and an **LSTM (RNN) Model** to process traffic video footage and predict optimal traffic light intervals.

## Features
- **Video Processing with YOLO & OpenCV**
- **AI Traffic Prediction (LSTM Model)**: Predicts future traffic flow trends.
- **Web Interface (React.js)**: Allows users to upload videos and view predictions.
- **Backend API (Node.js + Express.js)**: Handles video processing and AI model execution.
- **Deployment on Microsoft Azure**: Fully hosted backend & frontend on Azure.
